# Project Overview

This project serves as a foundational introduction to data analysis using Python. It focuses on reading, exploring, and manipulating spreadsheet data with the help of libraries such as pandas, while performing tasks like:

    ->Loading Excel files
    ->Filtering datasets
    ->Identifying unique values
    ->Calculating summary statistics
    ->Exporting processed results

Although the project operates at a basic level, it effectively builds essential skills in data handling and analysis. 
Completing it provides a solid starting point and encourages progression into more advanced, comprehensive data analysis projects in the future. As you grow more comfortable with these fundamental techniques, you’ll be better prepared to explore deeper topics such as data visualization, predictive modeling, and machine learning.
